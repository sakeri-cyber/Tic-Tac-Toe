In the section **\"*Design of a learning system*\"**, Mitchell describes the set up of a self learning checkers program. This is an attempt at trying to implement the approach for a tic-tac-toe game.**\n\n\n## Objective:\n* \tTo design a program that learns to play tic-tac-toe on its own\n* \tThe program is expected to learn by playing a large number of iterations of the game\n* \tThe program is not provided prior information about the game, the only information supplied to it is whether the game was won/lost/drawn\n\n## Methodology:\n\nTo break down the problem into simpler parts, let us define some terminologies. \n\n**The self learning Program**:\n\nThe self learning program is the system that is expected to learn to play tic-tac-toe. It consists of the following components:\n* \t**Legal Moves Generator:**\n    * For a given board state, the Legal Moves Generator outputs the set of all possible legal next board states for a player\n    \n* \t**Evaluator (Neural Network Model):**\n    * For a given board state, the evaluator predicts a score\n    \n*   **Program Move Selector:**\n    * For a given board state, the Program Move Selector selects the next move for the Program using the following approach:\n    \n        *     Use the **Legal Moves Generator** to obtain the set of all possible legal next board states\n        *     For each of the possible legal next board states above, use the **Evaluator** and predict a score\n        *     The possible next board state with the highest predicted score is chosen for the next move\n        \n\n\n**Thus, the task of \"learning\" to play tic-tac-toe, can be reduced to the task of training the Evaluator to assign higher scores to board states favourable to the Program, and lower scores to board states that are unfavourable to the Program**\n\nBelow is a visual representation of the program:\n\n\n![](https://image.ibb.co/dMXjKq/program-diagram-kaggle-v2.png)\n   \n   \n\n\n**Training the Program**\n*         The Program is trained by playing several iterations of games against a coded opponent\n*         **The \"Evaluator\" mentioned above, is a neural network model**\n*         During the first game, the neural network (Evaluator) is initialized with random weights\n*         After the program plays the first game, the scores output by the neural network are corrected as follows:\n    *         If the game was won by the program, assign the last board state a score of 1. Similarly, assign a score of -1 if the game was lost, and 0 if the game was drawn\n    *         For each of the previous board states, assign the score that was predicted to the next board state\n    *         For example, the second last board state is assigned the score that was predicted for the last board state, and so on\n*         Update the weights of the neural network (using SGD) by fitting it to the board states and the corrected scores\n*         Repeat the above process over and over, over a large number of games, updating the neural network after every game\n*         The logic of the approach is that, for a player, if the final board state was a winning state, then the board states leading up to the final state would also be favourable\n*         As the weight update process repeats over games, the neural network learns to assign a higher score to favourable board states, and lower scores to unfavourable board states\n* Below is a diagram of the how the weights of the model would update after each game:\n\n\n![](https://image.ibb.co/cf8oUq/training-kaggle-v3.png)\n  \n### Table of contents\n1.

Creating the opponent (The Opponent Move Selector)\n\nFor our program to self learn, it needs to play several games of tic-tac-toe.\n\nBut with who will it play with?\n\nIn the book \"[Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mitchell/ftp/mlbook.html)\", Mitchell describes the self learning checkers program learning by playing games against itself.\n\nIn older versions of this kernel, I did attempt to set it up so that the program was used to make the moves for both players.\n\nHowever, the problem is that Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game, and after about 10-15 games, I would always find that the program and the opponent program fell into a sync and played the same game (making the same moves) over and over, since they were using the same model.\n\nMaybe this would work better for a more complex game like checkers.\n\nHence in this case, the set up is that the program learns by playing games against a coded opponent. \n\nThe opponent is coded to do the following:\n* **If playing in \"Easy\" mode:**\n    * When it is your turn, use the Legal Moves Generator to get all possible legal next moves\n    * Pick a legal move at random\n    * Repeat above until the end of the game\n  \n* **If playing in \"Hard\" mode:**\n    * When it is your turn, use the Legal Moves Generator to get all possible legal next moves\n    * Of the above legal moves, if any legal move makes you win (along row/column/diagonal), pick that legal move\n    * Else, if any legal move prevents your opponent (program) from winning when it is one move away from a win, pick that move\n    * Else, if any legal move leads to a row/diagonal/column having two 0's and no 1's (program's mark) , pick that legal move\n    * If none of the above conditions exist, pick a legal move at random\n\n\nThe Program is trained by repeatedly playing games against the above opponent and updating the weights of the model at the end of each game.\n\nEach game is played at either \"Easy\" or \"Hard\" mode, which is picked at random at the start of each game.\n\nThe \"Easy\" mode helps the Program explore the tic-tac-toe space. The \"Hard\" mode helps the Program learn how to play with a real opponent. \n\nI arrived at the above approach for the opponent after different iterations in previous versions of this kernel , and can be further improved, I welcome suggestions with regards to that."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5d4efd92c270b630b326141e4d104dd675259bdf","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def

Training the Program\n\nTraining the progam is essentially training the Evaluator(model) to assign higher scores to board states favourable to the program, and lower scores to board states unfavourable to the program.\n\nThe progam is expected to learn by playing games against the Opponent.\n\nThe Evaluator (model) is trained in the following way:\n* At first the weights of the model are randomly assigned\n* Using this model, the Move Selector function selects the next move to make for the program\n* The program and the opponent make thier moves until the game ends\n* After the game is completed, the scores are corrected as follows:\n    * If the game was Won by the program, assign the score 1 to the final board state, or assign -1 if lost or 0 if drawn\n    * Shift the remaining scores so that they become the scores of the previous board states\n    * Update the weights of the model using the board state and corrected score\n* The above process is repeated over 100s of thousands of games\n* It is expected that eventually, the Evaluator (model) learns to assign higher scores to more favourable board states and lower scores to less favourable board states\n\n\n\n![](https://image.ibb.co/cf8oUq/training-kaggle-v3.png)\n\n\n\n#### An intuitive explanation of the above logic:\n\nhttps://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3296/why-does-the-experience-propagation-rule-for-checkers-work-in-tom-mitchells-boo\n\n* Remember that the only information provided to the model is whether the game was won, lost or drawn\n* If a game was won by the Program, it means that the final board state was a winning board state. Furthermore, it means that the second last board state, which was only 1 move away from winning, was a very favourable board state for the Program. The same goes for the third last, fourth last and so on\n* At the end of each game, depending on whether the Progam won/lost/drawn, the score for the final board state is corrected by setting it to 1 or -1 or 0 respectively. The scores for the other board states are corrected by assigning the score predicted for the successor board state. The model weights are then updated by fitting it to the board state and corrected score\n* Over several iterations of the games, as the experience propogrates backwards, it is expected that the model learns to predict higher scores board states favourable to the Program, and lower scores to board states unfavourable to the Program\n\nMitchell states in his book that this approach has been found to be surprisingly effective for the checkers player, and has been known to converge to the target function well."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"scrolled":false,"_uuid":"801e93004e6dcb4ebcef139cd45b81f487abbe7d","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def train(model,mode,print_progress=False):\n    \"\"\"Function trains the Evaluator (model) by playing a game against an opponent \n    playing random moves, and updates the weights of the model after the game\n    \n    Note that the model weights are updated using SGD with a batch size of 1\n\n    Args:\n    model: The Evaluator function being trained\n\n    Returns:\n    model: The model updated using SGD\n    y: The corrected scores\n\n    \"\"\" \n    # start the game\n    if print_progress==True:\n        print(\"___________________________________________________________________\")\n        print(\"Starting a new game\")\n    game=tic_tac_toe_game()\n    game.toss()\n    scores_list=[]\n    corrected_scores_list=[]\n    new_board_states_list=[]\n    \n    while(1):\n        if game.game_status()==\"In Progress\" and game.turn_monitor==1:\n            # If its the program's turn, use the Move Selector function to select the next move\n            selected_move,new_board_state,score=move_selector(model,game.board,game.turn_monitor)\n            scores_list.append(score[0][0])\n            new_board_states_list.append(new_board_state)\n            # Make the next move\n            game_status,board=game.move(game.turn_monitor,selected_move)\n            if print_progress==True:\n                print(\"Program's Move\")\n                print(board)\n                print(\"\\n\")\n        elif game.game_status()==\"In Progress\" and game.turn_monitor==0:\n            selected_move=opponent_move_selector(game.board,game.turn_monitor,mode=mode)\n        \n            # Make the next move\n            game_status,board=game.move(game.turn_monitor,selected_move)\n            if print_progress==True:\n                print(\"Opponent's Move\")\n                print(board)\n                print(\"\\n\")\n        else:\n            break\n\n    \n    # Correct the scores, assigning 1/0/-1 to the winning/drawn/losing final board state, \n    # and assigning the other previous board states the score of their next board state\n    new_board_states_list=tuple(new_board_states_list)\n    new_board_states_list=np.vstack(new_board_states_list)\n    if game_status==\"Won\" and (1-game.turn_monitor)==1: \n        corrected_scores_list=shift(scores_list,-1,cval=1.0)\n        result=\"Won\"\n    if game_status==\"Won\" and (1-game.turn_monitor)!=1:\n        corrected_scores_list=shift(scores_list,-1,cval=-1.0)\n        result=\"Lost\"\n    if game_status==\"Drawn\":\n        corrected_scores_list=shift(scores_list,-1,cval=0.0)\n        result=\"Drawn\"\n    if print_progress==True:\n        print(\"Program has \",result)\n        print(\"\\n Correcting the Scores and Updating the model weights:\")\n        print(\"___________________________________________________________________\\n\")\n        \n    x=new_board_states_list\n    y=corrected_scores_list\n    \n    def unison_shuffled_copies(a, b):\n        assert len(a) == len(b)\n        p = np.random.permutation(len(a))\n        return a[p], b[p]\n    \n    # shuffle x and y in unison\n    x,y=unison_shuffled_copies(x,y)\n    x=x.reshape(-1,9) \n    \n    # update the weights of the model, one record at a time\n    model.fit(x,y,epochs=1,batch_size=1,verbose=0)\n    return model,y,result","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"bbede244b95049b49cf63e5a8c63513b563c9051"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A sample single training game\n\nNote that the program will always play the mark '1' and the opponent will always play mark '0'.\n\nbelow, we run a single iteration of training, or in other words, a single game of tic-tac-toe between the program and opponent."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8c0e5dab654ab329ab1dbcf4926ce3102536d77d","scrolled":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"updated_model,y,result=train(model,mode=\"Hard\",print_progress=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"9fe335ae186f28d1a8254ef6f3159729101eda57"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Training by playing a large number of games\n\nWe play 200,000 games of tic-tac-toe between the program and the opponent.
